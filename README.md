# ukbiobank
Resources for working with UKBiobank as a DataLad dataset

## What we would like to achieve

- Be able to check that a new download is yielding the same data (integrity)
- Launch reproducible transformations to build derived datasets
  * BIDS input would be widely used
  * Setup a list of "community standard" processing
- Manage integrity of scripts 
- Limit dataset storage number of inodes  
- Capture the provenance - being to drop intermediate steps that can be reproduced
